 Displays scores from Klout and PeerIndex in widget.

== Description ==

Displays scores from <a href="http://klout.com">Klout<a> and <a href="http://peerindex.net">PeerIndex<a/> in widget.

Set up accounts on Klout and PeerIndex *before* activating the plugin.  Sometimes, it takes a while
for PeerIndex to calulate a score. If your score on the PeerIndex website is "N/A", then the plugin will
not display any information for PeerIndex.  Because Klout info comes from an iframe and there's no API, you see what
Klout provides.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files (social-media-metrics.php, README.TXT) to the `/wp-content/plugins/social-media-metrics` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. From APPEARANCE -> WIDGETS, drag the widget to an appropriate location. Enter your twitter ID 
   without the "@", and optionally a title for the widget to display.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

please let me know.

= What about foo bar? =
